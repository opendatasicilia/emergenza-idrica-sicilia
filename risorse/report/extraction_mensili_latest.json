There are some differences in the dam names, but they are considered similar and do not affect the validity. Specifically, 'Leone' and 'Piano del Leone' are considered the same dam, as are 'Ogliastro (Don Sturzo)' and 'DON STURZO (Ogliastro)', and 'Ragoleto' and 'RAGOLETO (Dirillo)'. The case of the names is ignored.",
