There are some differences in the dam names, but they are considered similar and do not invalidate the report. Specifically, 'Leone' and 'Piano del Leone', 'Ogliastro (Don Sturzo)' and 'DON STURZO (Ogliastro)', 'Ragoleto' and 'RAGOLETO (Dirillo)' are considered the same dam with slightly different names.",
