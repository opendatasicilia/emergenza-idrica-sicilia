  "summary": "The two CSV files have the same number of rows and the volume values are identical across all corresponding dams. There are slight differences in the names of some dams, such as 'Garcia (M. Francese)' vs 'GARCIA (Mario Francese)' and 'Leone' vs 'PIANO DEL LEONE' and 'Ragoleto' vs 'RAGOLETO (Dirillo)', but these differences do not invalidate the comparison as they are considered similar names. Therefore, the validation is successful.",
