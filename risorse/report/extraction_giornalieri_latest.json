There are some differences in the names of the dams (e.g., 'Leone' vs. 'Piano del Leone', 'Garcia (M. Francese)' vs. 'GARCIA', 'Ã€ncipa' vs 'ANCIPA', 'Piana Degli Albanesi' vs 'PIANA DEGLI ALBANESI') but these are considered acceptable variations and do not invalidate the comparison as requested.",
