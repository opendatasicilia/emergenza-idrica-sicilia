The validation depends only on the number of rows and the values of the volumes. There are no discrepancies in the volume values. The dam 'Leone' in the first CSV corresponds to 'Piano del Leone' in the second CSV. The names are similar. The keys of the 'cod' column are different but this is not relevant for the validation.",
