  "summary": "The validation failed because the second CSV file contains one additional dam compared to the first CSV file. The dam 'Piano del Leone' is present in the second file but missing in the first file. Although the dam names are similar ('Leone' vs 'Piano del Leone'), the first file is missing a record. There are no differences in the volume values for the dams present in both files. The difference in the number of dams is the main reason for failure.",
