  "summary": "The validation was successful. There are no discrepancies in the number of dams or in the volume values between the two CSV files. There are some slight differences in dam names, such as 'Garcia (M. Francese)' vs 'GARCIA' and 'Leone' vs 'PIANO DEL LEONE', but these are considered acceptable variations. All volume values match across the two files.",
