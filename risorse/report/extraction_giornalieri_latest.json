Although 'Leone' and 'Piano del Leone' could be considered similar, and name similarity isn't an error, the discrepancy in the number of dams makes the validation invalid. No discrepancies were found in the volume values for the dams present in both files. The names of the dams are similar, but not identical. Differences in capitalization were ignored when comparing dam names.",
