  "valid": false,
  "summary": "The validation failed because the names of some dams are different, and there are also differences in the total number of dams listed in the two files. Specifically, 'Garcia (M. Francese)' in the first file is listed as 'GARCIA' in the second file, and 'Leone' is listed as 'PIANO DEL LEONE'. Moreover, the first file has a 'cod' that starts with 'dig-', whereas the second file simply has a numerical 'cod'. These discrepancies cause the validation to fail because the focus is on comparing numerical values assuming consistent dam identification.",
