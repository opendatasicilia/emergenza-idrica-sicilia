There are no discrepancies in the values of 'volume' and 'volume_utile' for corresponding dams. Some dam names are slightly different but similar (e.g., 'Leone' vs. 'Piano del Leone', 'Garcia (M. Francese)' vs 'GARCIA'), which is acceptable. The case of the dam name is different, but it is expected. Therefore, the validation is considered successful.",
