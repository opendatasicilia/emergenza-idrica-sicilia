  "summary": "The validation was successful. The two CSV files have the same number of rows. There are no discrepancies in the volume values. There are some differences in the names of the dams. Specifically, 'Leone' in the first file is named 'Piano del Leone' in the second file, and 'Garcia (M. Francese)' is called 'GARCIA'. This difference in names does not invalidate the comparison.",
