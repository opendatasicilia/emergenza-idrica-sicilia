  "summary": "The validation failed due to discrepancies in the number of dams between the two files. The second file contains one additional dam ('Piano del Leone') that is not present in the first file. Also, there are name variations, such as 'Garcia (M. Francese)' in the first file and 'GARCIA' in the second, and 'Leone' vs 'Piano del Leone'. While name variations are tolerated, the difference in the number of dams makes the comparison invalid. It has been found a similar name. 'Leone' and 'Piano del Leone' are similar.",
