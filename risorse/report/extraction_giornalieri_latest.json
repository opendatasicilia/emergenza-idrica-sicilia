  "summary": "The comparison failed due to differences in the number of dams and slight variations in dam names. Specifically, the second CSV file contains one additional dam ('PIANO DEL LEONE' or 'Ragoleto (Dirillo)') that is not present in the first CSV file ('Leone' or 'Ragoleto'). While the volume values for the common dams are identical, the discrepancy in the dam count and naming conventions leads to an invalid comparison. The first CSV file contains 'Leone' and 'Ragoleto' while the second file contains 'Piano del Leone' e 'Ragoleto (Dirillo)'.",
