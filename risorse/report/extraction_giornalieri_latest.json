  "summary": "The validation was successful. The number of dams is the same in both files. There are minor differences in dam names (e.g., 'Garcia (M. Francese)' vs 'GARCIA' and 'Leone' vs 'PIANO DEL LEONE'), which do not invalidate the comparison as they likely refer to the same dams. All volume values match between the two files.",
