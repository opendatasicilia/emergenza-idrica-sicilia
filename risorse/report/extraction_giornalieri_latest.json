  "summary": "The comparison between the two CSV files was successful. The number of dams and their volumes are consistent across both files. There are some differences in the dam names. For example, 'leone' and 'piano del leone' likely refer to the same dam, and 'Garcia (M. Francese)' and 'GARCIA' also likely refer to the same dam. These naming variations do not affect the validity of the data regarding the number of dams and their volumes.",
