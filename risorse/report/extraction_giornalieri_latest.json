  "valid": false,
  "summary": "The validation failed because there is a discrepancy in the number of dams between the two files. The second file contains the dam 'PIANO DEL LEONE' (codice 6) which is missing in the first file. While 'Leone' and 'Piano del Leone' have similar names, the second file has 'Piano del Leone' while the first file has 'Leone'. Considering the task requirements, the absence of 'Piano del Leone' (present in the second file) in the first one means there is a mismatch. The remaining dam volume values match between the two files.",
