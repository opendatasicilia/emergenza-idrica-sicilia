{
  "valid": false,
  "summary": "The validation failed because there is a discrepancy in the number of dams. The first CSV file contains 12 dams, while the second CSV file also contains 12 dams. However, dam 'Leone' in the first file corresponds to 'Piano Del Leone' in the second file. Despite the name similarity, they are treated as the same dam for comparison purposes. There are no discrepancies in volume values. Thus, the number of dams is consistent across the two files, and there are no discrepancies in the volume values, therefore the validation should have passed if not for the case of the dam 'Leone' vs 'Piano del Leone'.",
