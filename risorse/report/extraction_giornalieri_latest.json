  "summary": "The validation was successful. The number of dams is the same in both files. All dams present in the first file are also present in the second file, and the values for 'volume' and 'volume_utile' match between the two files. Some dam names are similar but not identical (e.g., 'Leone' vs. 'Piano del Leone', 'Garcia (M. Francese)' vs. 'GARCIA', 'Piana Degli Albanesi' vs 'PIANA DEGLI ALBANESI'), but these differences do not invalidate the comparison as they likely refer to the same dams.",
