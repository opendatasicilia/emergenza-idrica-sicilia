Both CSV files contain the same number of rows (dams), and the values for 'volume_autorizzato', 'volume', and 'volume_utile' are identical across corresponding dams in both files. There are minor differences in dam names (e.g., 'Garcia (M. Francese)' vs. 'GARCIA', 'Leone' vs. 'PIANO DEL LEONE') but these do not indicate a data discrepancy.",
