  "valid": false,
  "summary": "The validation failed because the number of dams in the two CSV files differs. The second CSV file contains one more dam compared to the first CSV file. Specifically, the dam 'PIANO DEL LEONE' is present in the second file but not in the first file. Note that the names 'Leone' and 'Piano del Leone' are considered similar and the difference in names does not invalidate the report, only the presence of the extra dam does.",
